<!--  	.if \\nr==1 .EE -->
<!--  	.if \\nr==2 .FE -->
<!--  	.. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  Then, if register r is 0, everything from the .BS to the .ES will -->

<!--  -->
<!--  If register r is 2, .BS invokes .FS, and .ES invokes .FE; and -->

<!--  -->
<!--  Using a register with a 1-character name because it works nicely -->
<!--  with troff's -r option.  With the above macros, doing nothing -->
<!--  makes the optional comments to disappear, -rr1 makes them in to -->
<!--  end-notes, -rr2 for footnotes, and -rr3 for inline text. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  It probably isn't a good idea to do all that, though.  People will -->
<!--  just get confused about versions.  Better to just include or -->

<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
This document is an updated version of the
<i>Indian Hill C Style and Coding Standards</i>
paper, with modifications by the last three authors.
It describes a recommended coding standard for C programs.
The scope is coding style, not functional organization.
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
1. Introduction
</h2>
This document is a modified version of a document from
a committee formed at AT&amp;T's Indian Hill labs to establish
a common set of coding standards and recommendations for the
Indian Hill community.
<p>
The scope of this work is C coding style.
<!--  old: -->
<!--  -->
<!--  The scope of this work is C coding style, -->
<!--  rather than the functional organization of programs -->
<!--  or general issues such as the use of \fIgoto\fPs. -->
<!--  -->
The scope of this work is C coding style.
<!--  -->
<!--  "It's simply a matter of style, and while there -->
<!--  are many wrong styles, there really isn't any -->
<!--  one right style."      -- Ray Butterworth -->
<!--  -->
Good style should encourage consistent layout, improve
portability, and reduce errors.
</p><p>
This work does not cover functional organization, or general issues
such as the use of <tt>goto</tt>s.  We (see footnote 1) have tried to
combine previous work [1,6,8] on C style into a uniform set of
standards that should be appropriate for any project using C, although
parts are biased towards particular systems.  Of necessity, these
standards cannot cover all situations.  Experience and informed
judgement count for much.  Programmers who encounter unusual
situations should consult either experienced C programmers or code
written by experienced C programmers (preferably following these
rules).
</p><p>
The standards in this document are not of themselves required, but
individual institutions or groups may adopt part or all of them
as a part of program acceptance.
It is therefore likely that others at your institution will code in
a similar style.
Ultimately, the goal of these standards is to
increase portability, reduce maintenance, and above all
improve clarity.
</p><p>
Many of the style choices here are somewhat arbitrary.
Mixed coding style is harder to maintain than bad coding style.
When changing existing code it is better to conform to the
style (indentation, spacing, commenting, naming conventions)
of the existing code than it is to blindly follow this document.

<h2>
2. File Organization
</h2>
<p>
A file consists of various sections that should be separated by
several blank lines.  Although there is no maximum length limit for
source files, files with more than about 1000 lines are cumbersome to
deal with.  The editor may not have enough temp space to edit the
file, compilations will go more slowly, etc.  Many rows of asterisks,
for example, present little information compared to the time it takes
to scroll past, and are discouraged.  Lines longer than 79 columns are
not handled well by all terminals and should be avoided if possible.
Excessively long lines which result from deep indenting are often a
symptom of poorly-organized code.
</p><p>
</p><h3>
2.1 File Naming Conventions
</h3>
<p>
File names are made up of a base name, and an optional period and
suffix.  The first character of the name should be a letter and all
characters (except the period) should be lower-case letters and
numbers.  The base name should be eight or fewer characters and the
suffix should be three or fewer characters (four, if you include the
period).  These rules apply to both program files and default files
used and produced by the program (e.g., ``rogue.sav'').
<!--  -->
<!--  8 + 1 + 3 + ",v" fits RCS into Version 7 filesystems. -->
<!--  MS-DOS does 8 + "." + 3. -->
<!--  -->
</p><p>
Some compilers and tools require certain suffix conventions for names
of files [5].
The following suffixes are required:
</p><ul>
<li>
C source file names must end in <i>.c</i>
</li><li>
Assembler source file names must end in <i>.s</i>.
</li></ul>
The following conventions are universally followed:
<ul>
<li>
Relocatable object file names end in <i>.o</i>
</li><li>
Include header file names end in <i>.h</i>.
<br>
An alternate convention that may
be preferable in multi-language environments
is to suffix both the language type and <i>.h</i>
(e.g. ``foo.c.h'' or ``foo.ch'').
</li><li>
Yacc source file names end in <i>.y</i>
</li><li>
Lex source file names end in <i>.l</i>
</li></ul>
<p>
C++ has compiler-dependent suffix conventions,
including <i>.c</i>, <i>..c</i>, <i>.cc</i>, <i>.c.c</i>, and <i>.C</i>.
Since much C code is also C++ code, there is no clear solution here.
</p><p>
In addition,
it is conventional to use ``Makefile'' (not ``makefile'') for the
control file for <i>make</i> (for systems that support it)
and ``README'' for a summary of the contents
of the directory or directory tree.
<!--  -->
<!--  Having ``README'' in caps breaks the "monocase" rule, but is -->
<!--  convention.  Same for ``Makefile''. -->
<!--  -->
</p><p>
</p><h3>
2.2 Program Files
</h3>
<p>
The suggested order of sections for a program file is as follows:
</p><ol>
<li>
First in the file is a prologue that tells what is in that file.
A description of the purpose of the objects in the files (whether
they be functions, external data declarations or definitions, or
something else) is more useful than a list of the object names.
The prologue may optionally contain author(s),
revision control information, references, etc.
</li><li>
Any header file includes should be next.  If the include is for a
non-obvious reason, the reason should be commented.  In most cases,
system include files like <tt>stdio.h</tt> should be included before
user include files.
</li><li>
Any defines and typedefs that apply to the file as a whole are next.
One normal order is to have ``constant'' macros first, then
``function'' macros, then typedefs and enums. 
</li><li>
Next come the global (external) data declarations, usually in the
order: externs, non-static globals, static globals.  If a set of
defines applies to a particular piece of global data (such as a flags
word), the defines should be immediately after the data declaration or
embedded in structure declarations, indented to put the defines one
level deeper than the first keyword of the declaration to which they
apply.
</li><li>
The functions come last, and should be in some sort of meaningful
order.  Like functions should appear together.  A ``breadth-first''
approach (functions on a similar level of abstraction together) is
preferred over depth-first (functions defined as soon as possible
before or after their calls).  Considerable judgement is called for
here.  If defining large numbers of essentially-independent utility
functions, consider alphabetical order.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><h3>
2.3 Header Files
</h3>
<p>
Header files are files that are included in other files prior to
compilation by the C preprocessor.  Some, such as <tt>stdio.h</tt>,
are defined at the system level and must included by any program using
the standard I/O library.  Header files are also used to contain data
declarations and defines that are needed by more than one program.
Header files should be functionally organized, i.e., declarations for
separate subsystems should be in separate header files.  Also, if a
set of declarations is likely to change when code is ported from one
machine to another, those declarations should be in a separate header
file.
</p><p>
Avoid private header filenames that are the same as library header
filenames. The statement
</p><pre>#include "math.h"
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  Or try .Ep math.h """" """" -->
<!--  -->
will include the standard library math header file if the intended one
is not found in the current directory.  If this is what you
<i>want</i> to happen, comment this fact.  Don't use absolute
pathnames for header files. Use the <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> construction
for getting them from a standard place, or define them relative to the
current directory.  The ``include-path'' option of the C compiler (-I
on many systems) is the best way to handle extensive private libraries
of header files; it permits reorganizing the directory structure
without having to alter source files.
<p>
Header files that declare functions or external variables should be
included in the file that defines the function or variable.
That way, the compiler can do type checking and the external
declaration will always agree with the definition.
</p><p>
Defining variables in a header file is often a poor idea.  Frequently
it is a symptom of poor partitioning of code between files.  Also,
some objects like typedefs and initialized data definitions cannot be
seen twice by the compiler in one compilation.  On some systems,
repeating uninitialized declarations without the <tt>extern</tt>
keyword also causes problems.  Repeated declarations can happen if
include files are nested and will cause the compilation to fail.
</p><p>
Header files should not be nested.
<!--  -->
<!--  Many people disagree strongly with this. -->
<!--  However, if you are to use \fIone\fP style, then this is best. -->
<!--  The #ifndef/#define/.../#endif approach (below) often causes -->
<!--  compilations to go much slower. -->
<!--  A #endinput directive would be nice. -->
<!--  -->
The prologue for a header file should, therefore, describe what other
headers need to be #included for the header to be functional.  In
extreme cases, where a large number of header files are to be included
in several different source files, it is acceptable to put all common
#includes in one include 
file. 
</p><p>
It is common to put the following into each <i>.h</i> file to prevent
accidental double-inclusion. 
</p><pre>#ifndef EXAMPLE_H
#define EXAMPLE_H
 ...	<i>/* body of example.h file */</i>
#endif /* EXAMPLE_H */
</pre>
<p>
This double-inclusion mechanism should not be relied upon,
particularly to perform nested includes.
</p><p>
</p><h3>
2.4 Other Files
</h3>
<p>
It is conventional to have a file called ``README'' to document both
``the bigger picture'' and issues for the program as a whole.
For example, it is common to include a list of all conditional
compilation flags and what they mean.
It is also common to list files that are machine dependent, etc.

Comments

<!--  Gwyn -->
<!--  -->
<p>
The comments should describe <i>what</i> is happening,
<i>how</i> it is being done, what parameters mean,
<!--  -->
<!--  BUG: -->
<!--  By X3.159-1989, ``formal parameters'' are called `parameters' and -->
<!--  ``actual parameters'' are called `arguments'.  A somewhat relaxed -->
<!--  form lets us call anything an argument, but only some formal -->
<!--  parameters are `parameters'. -->
<!--  The two usages are used inconsistantly in this document. -->
<!--  -->
which globals are used and which are modified, and any restrictions or
bugs.  Avoid, however, comments that are clear from the code, as such
information rapidly gets out of date.  Comments that disagree with the
code are of negative value.  Short comments should be <i>what</i>
comments, such as ``compute mean value'', rather than <i>how</i>
comments such as ``sum of values divided by n''.  C is not assembler;
putting a comment at the top of a 3--10 line section telling what it
does overall is often more useful than a comment on each line
describing micrologic.
</p><p>
Comments should justify offensive code.  The justification should be
that something bad will happen if unoffensive code is used.  Just
making code faster is not enough to rationalize a hack; the
performance must be <i>shown</i> to be unacceptable without the hack.
The comment should explain the unacceptable behavior and describe why
the hack is a ``good'' fix.
</p><p>
Comments that describe data structures, algorithms, etc., should be
in block comment form with the opening <tt>/*</tt> in columns 1-2, a
<tt>*</tt> in column 2 before each line of comment text, and the
closing <tt>*/</tt> in columns 2-3. An alternative is to have
<tt>**</tt> in columns 1-2, and put the closing <tt>*/</tt>
also in 1-2.
</p><pre>/*
 *	Here is a block comment.
 *	The comment text should be tabbed or spaced over uniformly.
 *	The opening slash-star and closing star-slash are alone on a line.
 */
</pre>
<pre>/*
** Alternate format for block comments
*/
</pre>
<p>
Note that 
</p><pre>grep '^.\e*'
</pre> 
will catch all block comments in the file (see footnote 2). Very long
block comments such as drawn-out discussions and copyright notices
often start with <tt>/*</tt> in columns 1-2, no leading <tt>*</tt>
before lines of text, and the closing <tt>*/</tt> in columns 1-2.
Block comments inside a function are appropriate, and they should be
tabbed over to the same tab setting as the code that they describe.
One-line comments alone on a line should be indented to the tab
setting of the code that follows.
<pre>if (argc &gt; 1) {
	/* Get input file from command line. */
	if (freopen(argv[1], "r", stdin) == NULL) {
		perror (argv[1]);
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
Very short comments may appear on the same line as the code they
describe, and should be tabbed over to separate them from the
statements. If more than one short comment appears in a block of code
they should all be tabbed to the same tab setting.
</p><pre>if (a == EXCEPTION) {
	b = TRUE;				/* special case */
} else {
	b = isprime(a);			/* works only for odd a */
}
</pre>
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Declarations
</h2>
<p>
Global declarations should begin in column 1. All external data
declaration should be preceded by the <tt>extern</tt> keyword.
If an external variable is an array that is defined with an explicit
size, then the array bounds must be repeated in the extern
declaration unless the size is always encoded in the array
(e.g., a read-only character array that is always null-terminated).
Repeated size declarations are particularly beneficial to someone
picking up code written by another. 
<!--  -->
<!--  /* foo.h */ -->
<!--  #define SIZE 1234 -->
<!--  extern int zork[SIZE];	/* ... and not `extern int zork[];' */ -->
<!--  -->
<!--  /* foo.c */ -->
<!--  int zork[SIZE]; -->
<!--  -->
</p><p>
The ``pointer'' qualifier, <tt>*</tt>, should be with the variable
name rather than with the type.
</p><pre>char		*s, *t, *u;
</pre>
instead of
<pre>char*	s, t, u;
</pre>
which is wrong, since <tt>t</tt> and <tt>u</tt> do not get declared as
pointers. 
<p>
Unrelated declarations, even of the same type, should be on separate
lines.  A comment describing the role of the object being declared
should be included, with the exception that a list of
<tt>#define</tt>d constants do not need comments if the constant names
are sufficient documentation.  The names, values, and comments
are usually
<!--  should be -->
tabbed so that they line up underneath each other.  Use the tab
character rather than blanks (spaces).  For structure and union
template declarations, each element should be alone on a line
with a comment describing it. The opening brace (<tt>{</tt>) should be
on the same line as the structure tag, and the closing brace
(<tt>}</tt>) should be in column 1.
</p><pre>struct boat {
	int		wllength;	/* water line length in meters */
	int		type;		/* see below */
	long		sailarea;	/* sail area in square mm */
};

/* defines for boat.type */
#define	KETCH	(1)
#define	YAWL		(2)
#define	SLOOP	(3)
#define	SQRIG	(4)
#define	MOTOR	(5)
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  If this formatting `loses', you can probably fix it, but you'll -->
<!--  have to be careful about tabs that appear later. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  Set up a tab field, with the worst-case tabbing, more or less -->
<!--  .ta \w'MOTOR    'u -->
<!--  #define KETCH<tab>1 (etc.) -->
<!--  -->
<p>
These defines are sometimes put right after the declaration of
<i>type</i>, within the <tt>struct</tt> declaration, with enough
tabs after the <tt>#</tt> to indent <tt>define</tt> one level more
than the structure member declarations. When the actual values are
unimportant, the <tt>enum</tt> facility is better (see footnote 3).
</p><pre>enum bt { KETCH=1, YAWL, SLOOP, SQRIG, MOTOR };
struct boat {
	int		wllength;	/* water line length in meters */
	enum bt	type;		/* what kind of boat */
	long		sailarea;	/* sail area in square mm */
};
</pre>
<p>
Any variable whose initial value is important should be
<i>explicitly</i> initialized, or at the very least should be
commented to indicate that C's default initialization to zero
is being relied upon. The empty initializer,
``<tt>{ }</tt>,'' should never be used. Structure
initializations should be fully parenthesized with braces.
<!--  -->
<!--  Consider the following: -->
<!--  -->
<!--  struct foo {int i, j}; -->
<!--  struct foo bar[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; -->
<!--  struct foo kung[] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}; -->
<!--  struct foo oh[] = {}; -->
<!--  -->
<!--  `bar' is accepted, but is visually ambiguous. -->
<!--  `oh' is also accepted.  Don't do it -- what does it mean? -->
<!--  -->
<!--  The following is NOT ambiguous and is good style. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  struct foo kung[] = {{1}, {3}}; -->
<!--  -->
Constants used to initialize longs should be explicitly long. Use
capital letters; for example two long <tt>2l</tt> looks a lot like 
<tt>21</tt>, the number twenty-one.
</p><pre>int		x = 1;
char		*msg = "message";
struct boat	winner[] = {
	{ 40, YAWL, 6000000L },
	{ 28, MOTOR, 0L },
	{ 0 },
};
</pre>
<p>
In any file which is part of a larger whole rather than a
self-contained program, maximum use should be made of the
<tt>static</tt> keyword to make functions and variables local to
single files.  Variables in particular should be accessible from other
files only when there is a clear need that cannot be filled in another
way. Such usage should be commented to make it clear that another
file's variables are being used; the comment should name the other
file. If your debugger hides static objects you need to see during 
debugging, declare them as <tt>STATIC</tt> and <tt>#define STATIC</tt>
as needed.
</p><p>
The most important types should be highlighted by <tt>typedef</tt>fing
them, even if they are only integers, as the unique name makes the
program easier to read (as long as there are only a <i>few</i> things
typedeffed to integers!). Structures may be typedeffed when they are
declared.  Give the struct and the typedef the same name.
</p><pre>typedef struct splodge_t {
	int	sp_count;
	char	*sp_name, *sp_alias;
} splodge_t;
</pre>
<p>
The return type of functions should always be declared. If function
prototypes are available, use them. One common mistake is to omit the
declaration of external math functions that return <tt>double</tt>.
The compiler then assumes that the return value is an integer and the
bits are dutifully converted into a (meaningless) floating point
value.
</p><blockquote>
``<i>C takes the point of view that the programmer is always
right.</i>''  -- Michael DeCorte

<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Function Declarations
</h2>
<p>
Each function should be preceded by a block comment prologue that
gives a short description of what the function does and (if not clear)
how to use it.  Discussion of non-trivial design decisions and
side-effects is also appropriate.  Avoid duplicating information clear
from the code.
</p><p>
The function return type should be alone on a line, (optionally)
indented one stop (see footnote 4). Do not default to <tt>int</tt>;
if the function does not return a value then it should be given
return type <i>void</i> (see footnote 5). If the value returned
requires a long explanation, it should be given in the prologue;
otherwise it can be on the same line as the return type, tabbed over.
The function name (and the formal parameter list) should be alone on a
line, in column 1.  Destination (return value) parameters should
generally be first (on the left). All formal parameter declarations,
local declarations and code within the function body should be tabbed
over one stop.  The opening brace of the function body should be alone
on a line beginning in column 1.
</p><p>
Each parameter should be declared (do not default to <tt>int</tt>).
In general the role of each variable in the function should be
described.  This may either be done in the function comment or, if
each declaration is on its own line, in a comment on that line.  Loop
counters called ``i'', string pointers called ``s'', and integral
types called ``c'' and used for characters are typically excluded.  If
a group of functions all have a like parameter or local variable, it
helps to call the repeated variable by the same name in all functions.
(Conversely, avoid using the same name for different purposes in
related functions.)  Like parameters should also appear in the same
place in the various argument lists.
</p><p>
Comments for parameters and local variables should be tabbed so that
they line up underneath each other. Local variable declarations should
be separated from the function's statements by a blank line.
<!--  -->
<!-- 	int zork;			/* Last known zork. */ -->
<!-- 	struct price_tag inventory[MAX_STORES][MAX_STOCK] -->
<!-- 					/* Corporate structure. */ -->
<!-- 	some_really_long_type_name *tree; -->
<!-- 					/* root of the parse tree */ -->
<!-- 	char *s;			/* variable name */ -->
<!--  -->
<!--  If a variable has an extremely long definition, the comment -->
<!--  should come <I>after</I> the declaration.  Multiline comments -->
<!--  for variables should be moved to the header and referenced -->
<!--  from the comment. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 	* Note 1: The variable `zork' has two lives.  It first ... -->
<!-- 	*/ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 		void *zork;		/* See header note #1. */ -->
<!--  -->
</p><p>
Be careful when you use or declare functions that take a variable
number of arguments (``varargs'').  There is no truly portable way to
do varargs in C.  Better to design an interface that uses a fixed
number of arguments.  If you must have varargs, use the library macros
for declaring functions with variant argument lists.
</p><p>
If the function uses any external variables (or functions) that are
not declared globally in the file, these should have their own
declarations in the function body using the <tt>extern</tt> keyword.
</p><p>
Avoid local declarations that override declarations at higher levels.
In particular, local variables should not be redeclared in nested
blocks.  Although this is valid C, the potential confusion is enough
that <i>lint</i> will complain about it when given the --h option.

<!-- Use whitespace generously, both vertically and horizontally. -->
Use vertical and horizontal whitespace generously.  Indentation and
spacing should reflect the block structure of the code; e.g., there
should be at least 2 blank lines between the end of one function and
the comments for the next. 
</p><p>
A long string of conditional operators should be split
onto separate lines.
</p><pre>if (foo-&gt;next==NULL &amp;&amp; totalcount&lt;needed &amp;&amp; needed&lt;=MAX_ALLOT
	&amp;&amp; server_active(current_input)) { ...
</pre>
Might be better as
<pre>if (foo-&gt;next == NULL
	&amp;&amp; totalcount &lt; needed &amp;&amp; needed &lt;= MAX_ALLOT
	&amp;&amp; server_active(current_input))
{
	...
</pre>
Similarly, elaborate <tt>for</tt> loops should be split onto different
lines. 
<pre>for (curr = *listp, trail = listp;
	curr != NULL;
	trail = &amp;(curr-&gt;next), curr = curr-&gt;next )
{
	...
</pre>
Other complex expressions, particularly those using the ternary
<tt>? :</tt> operator,
are best split on to several lines, too.
<pre>c = (a == b)
	? d + f(a)
	: f(b) - d;
</pre>
<!--  <P> -->
<!--  Finally, the closing brace of long functions and very long blocks -->

<!--  .DS -->
<!--  \&	}	/* end  for (each list element) */ -->
<!--  \&	... -->
<!--  }	/* end function_name() */ -->
<p>
Keywords that are followed by expressions in parentheses
should be separated from the left parenthesis by a blank.
(The
<tt>sizeof</tt>
operator is an exception.)
<!--  -->
<!--  Because `sizeof' is an OPERATOR. -->
<!--  -->
Blanks should also appear after commas in argument lists to help
separate the arguments visually.  On the other hand, macro definitions
with arguments must not have a blank between the name and the left
parenthesis, otherwise the C preprocessor will not recognize the
argument list. 
<!--  -->
<!--  The C preprocessor requires the left parenthesis, -->

<h2>
Simple Statements
</h2>
<p>
There should be only one statement per line unless the statements are
very closely related.
</p><pre>case FOO:	  oogle (zork);  boogle (zork);  break;
case BAR:	  oogle (bork);  boogle (zork);  break;
case BAZ:	  oogle (gork);  boogle (bork);  break;
</pre>
The null body of a <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt> loop should be alone
on a line and commented so that it is clear that the null body is
intentional and not missing code.
<pre>while (*dest++ = *src++)
	;	/* VOID */
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  An alternative convention is to use -->
<!--  .Ep continue -->

<p>
Do not default the test for non-zero, i.e.
</p><pre>if (f() != FAIL)
</pre>
is better than
<pre>if (f())
</pre>
even though <tt>FAIL</tt> may have the value 0 which C considers to be
false.  An explicit test will help you out later when somebody decides
that a failure return should be --1 instead of 0. Explicit comparison
should be used even if the comparison value will never change; e.g., 
<pre>if (!(bufsize % sizeof(int)))
</pre>
should be written instead as
<pre>if ((bufsize % sizeof(int)) == 0)
</pre>
to reflect the <i>numeric</i> (not <i>boolean</i>) nature of the test.
A frequent trouble spot is using <tt>strcmp</tt> to test for string
equality, where the result should <i>never</i> <i>ever</i> be
defaulted. The preferred approach is to define a macro <i>STREQ</i>.
<pre>#define STREQ(a, b) (strcmp((a), (b)) == 0)
</pre>
<p>
The non-zero test <i>is</i> often defaulted for predicates
and other functions or expressions which meet the following
restrictions:
</p><ul>
<li>
Evaluates to 0 for false, nothing else.
</li><li>
Is named so that the meaning of (say) a `true' return
is absolutely obvious.
</li></ul>
Call a predicate <i>isvalid</i> or <i>valid</i>, not <i>checkvalid</i>.
<!--  -->
<!--  The non-zero test is also defaulted for NULL pointer checks, -->
<!--  e.g., -->
<!--  .Ep "p = malloc(n); if (!p) error()" ''. `` -->
<!--  It is defaulted because essentually you are saying ``allocate `p'. -->
<!--  If no `p', then error.'' -->
<!--  (Thus, it is covered by the existing rules.) -->
<!--  -->
<p>
It is common practice to declare a boolean type
<tt>bool</tt> in a global include file.
<!--  -->
<!--  Unfortunately, the ideal type to use may differ for scalar and -->
<!--  array variables. -->
<!--  -->
The special names improve readability immensely.
</p><pre>typedef int	bool;
#define FALSE	0
#define TRUE	1
</pre>
or
<pre>typedef enum { NO=0, YES } bool;
</pre>
<p>
Even with these declarations, do not check a boolean value for
equality with 1 (TRUE, YES, etc.); instead test for inequality with 0
(FALSE, NO, etc.). Most functions are guaranteed to return 0 if false,
but only non-zero if true. Thus,
</p><pre>if (func() == TRUE) { ...
</pre>
must be written
<pre>if (func() != FALSE) { ...
</pre>
It is even better (where possible) to rename the function/variable or
rewrite the expression so that the meaning is obvious without a
comparison to true or false (e.g., rename to <i>isvalid()</i>).
<p>
There is a time and a place for embedded assignment statements.
In some constructs there is no better way to accomplish the results
without making the code bulkier and less readable.
</p><pre>while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
	process the character
}
</pre>
The <tt>++</tt> and <tt>--</tt> operators count as assignment
statements. So, for many purposes, do functions with side effects.
Using embedded assignment statements to improve run-time performance
is also possible. However, one should consider the tradeoff between
increased speed and decreased maintainability that results when
embedded assignments are used in artificial places. For example,
<pre>a = b + c;
d = a + r;
</pre>
should not be replaced by
<pre>d = (a = b + c) + r;
</pre>
even though the latter may save one cycle. In the long run the time
difference between the two will decrease as the optimizer gains
maturity, while the difference in ease of maintenance will increase as
the human memory of what's going on in the latter piece of code begins
to fade. 
<p>
Goto statements should be used sparingly, as in any well-structured
code. The main place where they can be usefully employed is to break
out of several levels of <tt>switch</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, and
<tt>while</tt> nesting, although the need to do such a thing may
indicate that the inner constructs should be broken out into
a separate function, with a success/failure return code.
</p><pre>	for (...) {
		while (...) {
			...
			if (disaster)
				goto error;
	    
		}
	}
	...
error:
	clean up the mess
</pre>
When a <tt>goto</tt> is necessary the accompanying label should be
alone on a line and tabbed one stop to the left of the code that
follows. The goto should be commented (possibly in the block header)
as to its utility and purpose.  <tt>Continue</tt> should be used
sparingly and near the top of the loop.  <tt>Break</tt> is less
troublesome. 
<p>
Parameters to non-prototyped functions sometimes need to be promoted
explicitly. If, for example, a function expects a 32-bit <tt>long</tt>
and gets handed a 16-bit <tt>int</tt> instead, the stack can get
misaligned. Problems occur with pointer, integral, and floating-point
values. 
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Compound Statements
</h2>
<p>
A compound statement is a list of statements enclosed by braces.
There are many common ways of formatting the braces.  Be consistent
with your local standard, if you have one, or pick one and use it
consistently.  When editing someone else's code, <i>always</i> use the
style used in that code.
</p><pre>control {
        statement;
        statement;
}
</pre>
<p>
The style above is called ``K&amp;R style,'' and is preferred if you
haven't already got a favorite. With K&amp;R style, the <tt>else</tt>
part of an <tt>if-else</tt> statement and the <tt>while</tt> part of a
<tt>do-while</tt> statement should appear on the same line as the
close brace. With most other styles, the braces are always alone on a
line. 
</p><p>
When a block of code has several labels (unless there are a lot of
them), the labels are placed on separate lines. The fall-through
feature of the C <tt>switch</tt> statement, (that is, when there is no
<tt>break</tt> between a code segment and the next <tt>case</tt>
statement) must be commented for future maintenance. A lint-style
comment/directive is best. 
</p><pre>switch (expr) {
case ABC:
case DEF:
	statement;
	break;
case UVW:
	statement;
	/*FALLTHROUGH*/
case XYZ:
	statement;
	break;
}
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  You won't believe how long I struggled with the format of the -->
<!--  `switch' statement.  It took a lot of people beating on me to -->
<!--  convince me that it should look like the if...else arrangement -->
<!--  that I said is supposed to ``look like a generalized switch''. -->
<!--  Ok, so I'm a little slow some years... -->
<!--  -->
<p>
Here, the last <tt>break</tt> is unnecessary, but is required because
it prevents a fall-through error if another <tt>case</tt> is added
later after the last one. The <tt>default</tt> case, if used, should
be last and does not require a <tt>break</tt>  if it is last.
</p><p>
Whenever an <tt>if-else</tt> statement has a compound statement for
either the <tt>if</tt> or <tt>else</tt> section, the statements of
both the <tt>if</tt> and <tt>else</tt> sections should both be
enclosed in braces (called <i>fully bracketed syntax</i>).
</p><p>
</p><pre>if (expr) {
	statement;
} else {
	statement;
	statement;
}
</pre>
Braces are also essential in <i>if-if-else</i> sequences with no
second <i>else</i> such as the following, which will be parsed
incorrectly if the brace after <tt>(ex1)</tt> and its mate are
omitted:
<pre>if (ex1) {
	if (ex2) {
		funca();
	}
} else {
	funcb();
}
</pre>
<p>
An <i>if-else</i> with <i>else if</i> should
be written with the <i>else</i> conditions left-justified.
</p><pre>if (STREQ (reply, "yes")) {
	statements for yes
	...
} else if (STREQ (reply, "no")) {
	...
} else if (STREQ (reply, "maybe")) {
	...
} else {
	statements for default
	...
}
</pre>
The format then looks like a generalized <i>switch</i> statement and
the tabbing reflects the switch between exactly one of several
alternatives rather than a nesting of statements.
<p>
<tt>Do-while</tt> loops should always have braces around the body. 
</p><p>
The following code is very dangerous:
</p><pre>#ifdef CIRCUIT
#	define CLOSE_CIRCUIT(circno)	{ close_circ(circno); }
#else
#	define CLOSE_CIRCUIT(circno)
#endif

	...
	if (expr)
		statement;
	else
		CLOSE_CIRCUIT(x)
	++i;
</pre>
Note that on systems where CIRCUIT is not defined the statement
<tt>++i;</tt> will only get executed when <tt>expr</tt> is false!
This example points out both the value of naming macros with CAPS
and of making code fully-bracketed.
<p>
Sometimes an  <tt>if</tt> causes an unconditional control transfer via
<tt>break</tt>, <tt>continue</tt> ,<tt>goto</tt>, or <tt>return</tt>.
The <tt>else</tt> should be implicit and the code should not be
indented. 
</p><pre>if (level &gt; limit)
	return (OVERFLOW)
normal();
return (level);
</pre>
The ``flattened'' indentation tells the reader that the boolean test
is invariant over the rest of the enclosing block.
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Operators
</h2>
<p>
Unary operators should not be separated from their single operand.
Generally, all binary operators except `<tt>.</tt>' and `<tt>-&gt;</tt>'
should be separated from their operands by blanks. Some judgement is
called for in the case of complex expressions, which may be clearer if
the ``inner'' operators are not surrounded by spaces and the ``outer''
ones are. 
</p><p>
If you think an expression will be hard to read, consider breaking it
across lines.  Splitting at the lowest-precedence operator near the
break is best.  Since C has some unexpected precedence rules,
expressions involving mixed operators should be parenthesized.  Too
many parentheses, however, can make a line <i>harder</i> to read
because humans aren't good at parenthesis-matching.
</p><p>
There is a time and place for the binary comma operator, but generally
it should be avoided.  The comma operator is most useful to provide
multiple initializations or operations, as in <tt>for</tt> statements.
Complex expressions, for instance those with nested ternary <tt>?
:</tt> operators, can be confusing and should be avoided if possible.
There are some macros like <tt>getchar</tt> where both the ternary
operator and comma operators are useful.  The logical expression
operand before the <tt>? :</tt> should be parenthesized and both
return values must be the same type.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Naming Conventions
</h2>
<p>
Individual projects will no doubt have their own naming conventions.
There are some general rules however.
</p><ul>
<li>
Names with leading and trailing underscores are reserved for system
purposes and should not be used for any user-created names.  Most
systems use them for names that the user should not have to know.  If
you must have your own private identifiers, begin them with a letter
or two identifying the package to which they belong.
</li><li>
#define constants should be in all CAPS.
</li><li>
Enum constants are Capitalized or in all CAPS
</li><li>
Function, typedef, and variable names, as well as struct, union, and
enum tag names should be in lower case.
</li><li>
Many macro ``functions'' are in all CAPS. Some macros (such as
<tt>getchar</tt> and <tt>putchar</tt> ) are in lower case
since they may also exist as functions. Lower-case macro names are
only acceptable if the macros behave like a function call,
that is, they evaluate their parameters <i>exactly</i> once and
do not assign values to named parameters.
Sometimes it is impossible to write a macro that behaves like a
function even though the arguments are evaluated exactly once.
</li><li>
Avoid names that differ only in case, like <i>foo</i> and <i>Foo</i>.
Similarly, avoid <i>foobar</i> and <i>foo_bar</i>.
The potential for confusion is considerable.
</li><li>
Similarly, avoid names that look like each other.
On many terminals and printers, `l', `1' and `I' look quite similar.
A variable named `l' is particularly bad because it looks so much like
the constant `1'.
</li></ul>
<p>
In general, global names (including <tt>enum</tt>s) should have a
common prefix identifying the module that they belong with.
Globals may alternatively be grouped in a global structure.
<tt>Typedef</tt>fed names often have <tt>_t</tt> appended to their
name. 
</p><p>
Avoid names that might conflict with various standard
library names. Some systems will include more library code than you
want. Also, your program may be extended someday.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Constants
</h2>
<p>
Numerical constants should not be coded directly. The <tt>#define</tt>
feature of the C preprocessor should be used to give constants
meaningful names.  Symbolic constants make the code easier to read.
Defining the value in one place also makes it easier to administer
large programs since the constant value can be changed uniformly by
changing only the define.  The enumeration data type is a better way
to declare variables that take on only a discrete set of values, since
additional type checking is often available.  At the very least, any
directly-coded numerical constant must have a comment explaining the
derivation of the value.
</p><p>
Constants should be defined consistently with their use;
e.g. use <tt>540.0</tt> for a float instead of <tt>540</tt>
with an implicit float cast. There are some cases where the constants
0 and 1 may appear as themselves instead of as defines. For example if a
<tt>for</tt> loop indexes through an array, then
</p><pre>for (i = 0; i &lt; ARYBOUND; i++)
</pre>
is reasonable while the code
<pre>door_t *front_door = opens(door[i], 7);
if (front_door == 0)
	error("can't open %s\\\\n", door[i]);
</pre>
is not. In the last example <tt>front_door</tt> is a pointer.
When a value is a pointer it should be compared to <tt>NULL</tt>
instead of 0. <tt>NULL</tt> is available either as part of the
standard I/O library's header file <i>stdio.h</i> or in
<i>stdlib.h</i> for newer systems. Even simple values like 1 or 0 are
often better expressed using defines like <tt>TRUE</tt> and
<tt>FALSE</tt> (sometimes <tt>YES</tt> and <tt>NO</tt> read better).
<p>
Simple character constants should be defined as character literals
rather than numbers.  Non-text characters are discouraged as
non-portable.  If non-text characters are necessary, particularly if
they are used in strings, they should be written using a escape
character of three octal digits rather than one (e.g.,
<tt>'\007'</tt>).  Even so, such usage should be considered
machine-dependent and treated as such.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Macros
</h2>
<p>
Complex expressions can be used as macro parameters, and
operator-precedence problems can arise unless all occurrences of
parameters have parentheses around them.  There is little that can be
done about the problems caused by side effects in parameters except to
avoid side effects in expressions (a good idea anyway) and, when
possible, to write macros that evaluate their parameters exactly once.
There are times when it is impossible to write macros that act exactly
like functions.
<!--  <P> -->
<!--  Here are some classic macros. -->
<!--  .DS -->
<!--  #define INV(val)	1/val -->
<!--  \&... -->
<!--  	y = INV(*x);		/* turns into ``start comment''! */ -->
<!--  .DE -->
<!--  (The above does <I>not</I> start a comment with ANSI preprocesors.) -->
<!--  .DS -->
<!--  #define MAX(a,b)	(((a)>(b)) ? (a) : (b) ) -->
<!--  \&... -->
<!--  	k = MAX(i++,j++); -->
<!--  .DE -->
</p><p>
Some macros also exist as functions (e.g., <tt>getc</tt> and
<tt>fgetc</tt>).  The macro should be used in implementing the
function so that changes to the macro will be automatically reflected
in the function.  Care is needed when interchanging macros and
functions since function parameters are passed by value, while macro
parameters are passed by name substitution.
<!--  Carefree use of macros requires care when they are defined. -->
Carefree use of macros requires that they be declared carefully.
</p><p>
Macros should avoid using globals, since the global name may be hidden
by a local declaration.  Macros that change named parameters (rather
than the storage they point at) or may be used as the left-hand side
of an assignment should mention this in their comments.  Macros that
take no parameters but reference variables, are long, or are aliases
for function calls should be given an empty parameter list, e.g.,
</p><pre>#define	OFF_A()	(a_global+OFFSET)
#define	BORK()	(zork())
#define	SP3()	if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; }
</pre>
<p>
Macros save function call/return overhead, but when a macro gets long,
the effect of the call/return becomes negligible, so a function should
be used instead.
</p><p>
In some cases it is appropriate to make the compiler
insure that a macro is terminated with a semicolon.
</p><pre>if (x==3)
    SP3();
else
    BORK();
</pre>
If the semicolon is omitted after the call to <tt>SP3</tt>, then the
<tt>else</tt> will (silently!) become associated with the <tt>if</tt>
in the <tt>SP3</tt> macro. With the semicolon, the <tt>else</tt>
doesn't match <i>any</i> <tt>if</tt> !
The macro
<tt>SP3</tt>
can be written safely as
<pre>#define SP3() \\\\
	do { if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; }} while (0)
</pre>
Writing out the enclosing <tt>do-while</tt> by hand is awkward and
some compilers and tools may complain that there is a constant in the
<tt>while</tt> conditional. A macro for declaring statements may make
programming easier. 
<pre>#ifdef lint
	static int ZERO;
#else
#	define ZERO 0
#endif
#define STMT( stuff )		do { stuff } while (ZERO)
</pre>
Declare <tt>SP3</tt> with
<pre>#define SP3() \\\\
	STMT( if (b) { int x; av = f (&amp;x); bv += x; } )
</pre>
Using <tt>STMT</tt> will help prevent small typos from silently
changing programs. 
<p>
Except for type casts, <tt>sizeof</tt>, and hacks such as the above,
macros should contain keywords only if the entire macro is surrounded
by braces. 
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Conditional Compilation
</h2>
<p>
Conditional compilation is useful for things like
machine-dependencies, debugging, and for setting certain options at
compile-time.  Beware of conditional compilation.  Various controls
can easily combine in unforeseen ways.  If you <tt>#ifdef</tt> machine
dependencies, make sure that when no machine is specified, the result
is an error, not a default machine.  (Use <tt>#error</tt> and indent
it so it works with older compilers.)  If you <tt>#ifdef</tt>
optimizations, the default should be the unoptimized code rather than
an uncompilable program.  Be sure to test the unoptimized code.
</p><p>
Note that the text inside of an <tt>#ifdef</tt>fed section may be
scanned (processed) by the compiler, even if the #ifdef is
false. Thus, even if the <tt>#ifdef</tt>fed part of the file never
gets compiled (e.g., <tt>#ifdef COMMENT</tt>), it cannot be arbitrary
text.
</p><p>
Put <tt>#ifdef</tt>s in header files instead of source files when
possible.  Use the <tt>#ifdef</tt>s to define macros that can be used
uniformly in the code.  For instance, a header file for checking
memory allocation might look like (omitting definitions
for<tt>REALLOC</tt> and <tt>FREE</tt>):
</p><pre>#ifdef DEBUG
	extern void *mm_malloc();
#	define MALLOC(size) (mm_malloc(size))
#else
	extern void *malloc();
#	define MALLOC(size) (malloc(size))
#endif
</pre>
<p>
Conditional compilation should generally be on a feature-by-feature
basis.  Machine or operating system dependencies should be avoided in
most cases. 
</p><pre>#ifdef BSD4
	long t = time ((long *)NULL);
#endif
</pre>
The preceding code is poor for two reasons: there may be 4BSD systems
for which there is a better choice, and there may be non-4BSD systems
for which the above <i>is</i> the best code.  Instead, use
<i>define</i> symbols such as <tt>TIME_LONG</tt> and
<tt>TIME_STRUCT</tt> and define the appropriate one in a configuration
file such as <i>config.h</i>.

Debugging
</h2>

<p>
If you use <tt>enum</tt>s, the first enum constant should have a
non-zero value, or the first constant should indicate an error.
</p><pre>enum { STATE_ERR, STATE_START, STATE_NORMAL, STATE_END } state_t;
enum { VAL_NEW=1, VAL_NORMAL, VAL_DYING, VAL_DEAD } value_t;
</pre>
Uninitialized values will then often ``catch themselves''.
<p>
Check for error return values, even from functions that ``can't''
fail. Consider that <tt>close()</tt> and <tt>fclose()</tt>
can and do fail, even when all prior file operations have succeeded.
Write your own functions so that they test for errors and return error
values or abort the program in a well-defined way. Include a lot of
debugging and error-checking code and leave most of it in the finished
product. Check even for ``impossible'' errors. [8]

Use the <tt>assert</tt> facility to insist that each function is being
passed well-defined values, and that intermediate results are

For instance, if <tt>mm_malloc</tt> is a debugging memory allocator,
then <tt>MALLOC</tt> will select the appropriate allocator, avoids
littering the code with <tt>#ifdef</tt>s, and makes clear the
difference between allocation calls being debugged and extra memory
that is allocated only during debugging. 
</p><pre>#ifdef DEBUG
#	define MALLOC(size)  (mm_malloc(size))
#else
#	define MALLOC(size)  (malloc(size))
#endif
</pre>
<p>
Check bounds even on things that ``can't'' overflow.  A function that
writes on to variable-sized storage should take an argument
<tt>maxsize</tt> that is the size of the destination. If there are
times when the size of the destination is unknown, some `magic' value
of <tt>maxsize</tt> should mean ``no bounds checks''. When bound
checks fail, make sure that the function does something useful such as
abort or return an error status. 
</p><pre>/*
 * INPUT: A null-terminated source string `src' to copy from and

In all, remember that a program that produces wrong answers twice as
fast is infinitely slower.  The same is true of programs that crash
occasionally or clobber valid data.

The advantages of portable code are well known.  This section gives
some guidelines for writing portable code.  Here, ``portable'' means
that a source file can be compiled and executed on different machines
with the only change being the inclusion of possibly different header
files and the use of different compiler flags.  The header files will
contain #defines and typedefs that may vary from machine to machine.
In general, a new ``machine'' is different hardware, a different
operating system, a different compiler, or any combination of these.
Reference [1] contains useful information on both style and
portability.
<!--  Does it really? -->
The following is a list of pitfalls to be avoided and recommendations
to be considered when designing portable code:
</p><ul>
<li>
Write portable code first, worry about detail optimizations only on
machines where they prove necessary.  Optimized code is often obscure.
Optimizations for one machine may produce worse code on another.
Document performance hacks and localize them as much as possible.
Documentation should explain <i>how</i> it works and <i>why</i> it was
needed (e.g., ``loop executes 6 zillion times'').
</li><li>
Recognize that some things are inherently non-portable.  Examples are
code to deal with particular hardware registers such as the program
status word, and code that is designed to support a particular piece
of hardware, such as an assembler or I/O driver.  Even in these cases
there are many routines and data organizations that can be made
machine independent.
</li><li>
Organize source files so that the machine-independent code and the
machine-dependent code are in separate files.  Then if the program is
to be moved to a new machine, it is a much easier task to determine
what needs to be changed.  Comment the machine dependence in the
headers of the appropriate files.
</li><li>
Any behavior that is described as ``implementation defined''
should be treated as a machine (compiler) dependency.
Assume that the compiler or hardware does it some completely screwy
way.
</li><li>
Pay attention to word sizes.  Objects may be non-intuitive sizes,
Pointers are not always the same size as <i>int</i>s, the same size as
each other, or freely interconvertible.  The following table shows bit
sizes for basic types in C for various machines and compilers.

Some machines have more than one possible size for a given type.  The
size you get can depend both on the compiler and on various
compile-time flags.  The following table shows ``safe'' type sizes on
the majority of systems.  Unsigned numbers are the same bit size as
signed numbers.

</li><li> The <tt>void*</tt> type is guaranteed to have enough bits
of precision to hold a pointer to any data object.
The <tt>void(*)()</tt> type is guaranteed to be able to hold a pointer
to any function. Use these types when you need a generic pointer.
(Use <tt>char*</tt> and <tt>char(*)()</tt>, respectively, in older
compilers).
<!--  -->
<!--  Any return value should do; `int(*)()' makes more sense, -->
<!--  but then it's hard to #define back and forth between dpANS -->
<!--  (void means void) and older compilers (#define void ...). -->
<!--  You still bite the farm if the compiler understands void but -->
<!--  not void*. -->
<!--  -->
Be sure to cast pointers back to the correct type before using them.
</li><li>
Even when, say, an <tt>int*</tt> and a <tt>char*</tt> are the same
<i>size</i>, they may have different <i>formats</i>. For example, the
following will fail on some machines that have <tt>sizeof(int*)</tt> 
equal to <tt>sizeof(char*)</tt>. The code fails because <tt>free</tt>
expects a <tt>char*</tt> and gets passed an <tt>int* .</tt>
<!--  See the comment above about the KCC compiler for DEC-20s -->
<pre>int *p = (int *) malloc (sizeof(int));
free (p);
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  Another example: -->
<!--  Consider the \fBqsort\fP routine, which takes a pointer to an array -->
<!--  of `things', the size of each element, and a comparison function. -->
<!--  Sorting an array of \fBstruct foo\fP, you may be tempted to say -->
<!--  <PRE> -->
<!--  int compare (struct foo *a, struct foo *b) { ... } -->
<!--  qsort ((void*)argv, argc, sizeof(struct foo), compare); -->
<!--  </PRE> -->
<!--  This will surely bomb on some machines, however. -->
<!--  .Ep compare() -->
<!--  takes pointers to two -->
<!--  .Ec struct Ps, -->
<!--  while -->
<!--  .Ep qsort() -->
<!--  will <I>call</I> it with two -->
<!--  .Ec void* s. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Note that the <i>size</i> of an object does not guarantee the
<i>precision</i> of that object. The Cray-2 may use 64 bits to store
an <tt>int</tt>, but a <i>long</i> cast into an <tt>int</tt>
and back to a <tt>long</tt> may be truncated to 32 bits.
</li><li>
The integer <i>constant</i> zero may be cast to any pointer type.  The
resulting pointer is called a <i>null pointer</i> for that type, and
is different from any other pointer of that type.  A null pointer
always compares equal to the constant zero.  A null pointer might
<i>not</i> compare equal with a variable that has the value zero. Null
pointers are <i>not</i> always stored with all bits zero.  Null
pointers for two different types are sometimes different.  A null
pointer of one type cast in to a pointer of another type will be cast
in to the null pointer for that second type.
<!--  -->
<!--  The name of the null pointer is called "NULL". -->
<!--  But that's just what the name is called. -->
<!--  The name is really "0" (cast or otherwise coerced to a pointer value). -->
<!--  But again, that's just the name. -->
<!--  The actual null pointer can have any bitwise value the implementor chooses. -->
<!-- 			-- Wayne Throop (alluding to Lewis Carroll) -->
<!--  -->
<!--  In C, the name of the nil pointer is called "NULL". -->
<!--  But that's only what the name is CALLED, you see. -->
<!--  The NAME of the nil pointer is "0". -->
<!--  The nil pointer itself can have any bit pattern it pleases.  -->
<!-- 			-- Wayne Throop (alluding to Lewis Carroll) -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
On <font size="-1">ANSI</font> compilers, when two pointers of the same type access
the same storage, they will compare as equal. When non-zero integer
constants are cast to pointer types, they may become identical to
other pointers. On non-<font size="-1">ANSI</font> compilers, pointers that 
access the same storage may compare as different. The following two
pointers, for instance, may or may not compare equal, and they may or
may not access the same storage (see footnote 6).
<pre>((int *) 2 )
((int *) 3 )
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  This is true, for instance, on the 8086, where the least- -->
<!--  -significant bit is always ignored, except when accessing -->
<!--  byte-sized values.  The pointer comparison (==) uses <I>all</I> -->
<!--  bits, so the two pointers do <I>not</I> compare the same. -->
<!--  -->
If you need `magic' pointers other than NULL, either allocate some
storage or treat the pointer as a machine dependence.
<pre>extern int x_int_dummy;		/* in x.c */
#define X_FAIL	(NULL)
#define X_BUSY	(&amp;x_int_dummy)
</pre>
<pre>#define X_FAIL	(NULL)
#define X_BUSY	MD_PTR1		/* MD_PTR1 from "machdep.h" */
</pre>
</li><li>
Floating-point numbers have both a <i>precision</i> and a <i>range</i>.
These are independent of the size of the object. Thus, overflow
(underflow) for a 32-bit floating-point number will happen at
different values on different machines.  Also, 4.9 times 5.1 will
yield two different numbers on two different machines. Differences in
rounding and truncation can give surprisingly different answers.
<!--  -->
<!--  .QP -->
<!--  ``<I>10.0 times 0.1 is hardly ever 1.0</I>'' -- Kernighan and Plauger [9] -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
On some machines, a <tt>double</tt> may have <i>less</i> range or
precision than a  <tt>float</tt>.
</li><li>
On some machines the first half of a <tt>double</tt> may be a
<tt>float</tt> with similar value. Do <i>not</i> depend on this.
</li><li>
Watch out for signed characters.  On some <font size="-1">VAX</font>es, for instance,
characters are sign extended when used in expressions, which is not
the case on many other machines.  Code that assumes signed/unsigned is
unportable.  For example, <tt>array[c]</tt> won't work if <tt>c</tt>
is supposed to be positive and is instead signed and negative.  If you
must assume signed or unsigned characters, comment them as
<tt>SIGNED</tt> or <tt>UNSIGNED</tt> .  Unsigned behavior can be
guaranteed with <tt>unsigned char</tt>.
</li><li>
Avoid assuming <font size="-1">ASCII</font>.
<!--  -->
<!--  (Use -->
<!--  .Ep "<ctype.h>" -->
<!--  where possible, but beware that their behavior varies considerably -->
<!--  between C implementations. -->
<!--  For instance, if c is not an upper-case letter, -->
<!--  tolower(c) may return c or garbage.) -->
<!--  -->
If you must assume, document and localize.
Remember that characters may hold (much) more than 8 bits.
</li><li>
Code that takes advantage of the two's complement representation of
numbers on most machines should not be used.  Optimizations that
replace arithmetic operations with equivalent shifting operations are
particularly suspect.  If absolutely necessary, machine-dependent code
should be <tt>#ifdef</tt>fed or operations should be performed by
<tt>#ifdef</tt>fed macros.  You should weigh the time savings with the
potential for obscure and difficult bugs when your code is moved.
</li><li>
In general, if the word size or value range is important, typedef
``sized'' types.  Large programs should have a central header file
which supplies typedefs for commonly-used width-sensitive types, to
make it easier to change them and to aid in finding width-sensitive
code.  Unsigned types other than <tt>unsigned int</tt> are highly
compiler-dependent.  If a simple loop counter is being used where
either 16 or 32 bits will do, then use <tt>int</tt>, since it will get
the most efficient (natural) unit for the current machine.
<!--  -->
<!--  <side comment> -->
<!--  Actually, there are many machines that use ``unnatural'' -->
<!--  int sizes to cope with ``the world is a \s-1VAX\s+1'' problems. -->
<!--  The rule int == natural is still true, though. -->
<!--  Modern compilers have a switch that lets you select either -->
<!--  efficiency or bogus-\s-1VAX\s+1-code-compatibility. -->
<!--  On the other hand, this is still a lie, because the libraries -->
<!--  must work in any event. -->
<!--  On the other (third?) hand, modern systems are being fixed. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Data <i>alignment</i> is also important.  For instance, on various
machines a 4-byte integer may start at any address, start only at an
even address, or start only at a multiple-of-four address.  Thus, a
particular structure may have its elements at different offsets on
different machines, even when given elements are the same size on all
machines.  Indeed, a structure of a 32-bit pointer and an 8-bit
character may be 3 sizes on 3 different machines.  As a corollary,
pointers to objects may not be interchanged freely; saving an integer
through a pointer to 4 bytes starting at an odd address will sometimes
work, sometimes cause a core dump, and sometimes fail silently
(clobbering other data in the process).
<!--  -->
<!--  In particular, the \s-1VAX\s+1 will work, the 68000 (tho' not necessarily -->
<!--  other family members) will dump, and the 8086 (tho' not -->
<!--  necessarily other members) will ignore the lowest bit. -->
<!--  The IBM RT will silently round the address down to the nearest -->
<!--  multiple of four. -->
<!--  -->
Pointer-to-character is a particular trouble spot on machines which
do not address to the byte.
Alignment considerations and loader peculiarities make it very rash
to assume that two consecutively-declared variables are together
in memory, or that a variable of one type is aligned appropriately
to be used as another type.
</li><li>
The bytes of a word are of increasing significance with increasing
address on machines such as the <font size="-1">VAX</font> (little-endian) and of
decreasing significance with increasing address on other machines such
as the 68000 (big-endian).  The order of bytes in a word and of words
in larger objects (say, a double word) might not be the same.
<!--  -->
<!--  Consider, for example, the PDP-11, in which words are -->
<!--  little-endian, but the most-significant word of a long is stored -->
<!--  first. -->
<!--  -->
Hence any code that depends on the left-right orientation of bits
in an object deserves special scrutiny.
Bit fields within structure members will only be portable so long as
two separate fields are never concatenated and treated as a unit. [1,3]
Actually, it is nonportable to concatenate <i>any</i> two variables.
</li><li>
There may be unused holes in structures.  Suspect unions used for type
cheating.  Specifically, a value should not be stored as one type and
retrieved as another.  An explicit tag field for unions may be useful.
<!--  -->
<!--  <PRE> -->
<!--  enum union_tag_t { UT_ERROR, UT_INT, UT_FLOAT }; -->
<!--  struct good_t { -->
<!--  	enum union_tag_t tag; -->
<!--  	union { -->
<!--  		int i; -->
<!--  		float f; -->
<!--          } u; -->
<!--  } good_t; -->
<!--  </PRE> -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Different compilers use different conventions for returning
structures.  This causes a problem when libraries return structure
values to code compiled with a different compiler.  Structure pointers
are not a problem.
<!--  -->
<!--  Potentially, <I>any</I> parameter passing mechanism will vary -->
<!--  between compilers. -->
<!--  In general, compilers return word-size units in a fixed register -->
<!--  and (in general) structure pointers are word-sized, so structure -->
<!--  pointers are not a problem. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Do not make assumptions about the parameter passing mechanism.
especially pointer sizes and parameter evaluation order, size, etc.
The following code, for instance, is <i>very</i> nonportable.
<pre>	c = foo (getchar(), getchar());

	char
foo (c1, c2, c3)
	char c1, c2, c3;
{
	char bar = *(&amp;c1 + 1);
	return (bar);			/* often won't return c2 */
}
<!--  -->
<!--  It can be argued that if this *does* return c2, then -->
<!--  sizeof(char) == sizeof(int). -->
<!--  -->
</pre>
This example has lots of problems.  The stack may grow up or down
(indeed, there need not even be a stack!).  Parameters may be widened
when they are passed, so a <tt>char</tt> might be passed as an
<tt>int</tt>, for instance.  Arguments may be pushed left-to-right,
right-to-left, in arbitrary order, or passed in registers (not pushed
at all).  The order of evaluation may differ from the order in which
they are pushed.  One compiler may use several (incompatible) calling
conventions.
<!--  -->
<!--  <side comment> -->
<!--  One machine (??), for instance pushes R-to-L for compatibility -->
<!--  with Pascal, except for varargs, which are passed L-to-R to -->
<!--  make varargs work.  This always works since Pascal functions -->
<!--  are never called varargs. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
On some machines, the null character pointer <tt>((char *)0)</tt>
is treated the same way as a pointer to a null string. Do <i>not</i>
depend on this. 
</li><li>
Do not modify string constants (see footnote 7).
<!--  -->
<!--  .FS -->
<!--  .IP \*F -->
<!--  Note that an initialzed array is writable. -->
<!--  <PRE> -->
<!--  char s[] = "/dev/tty??"; -->
<!--  </PRE> -->
<!--  .FE -->
<!--  -->
One particularly notorious (bad) example is
<pre>s = "/dev/tty??";
strcpy (&amp;s[8], ttychars);
</pre>
</li><li>
The address space may have holes.  Simply <i>computing</i> the address
of an unallocated element in an array (before or after the actual
storage of the array) may crash the program.  If the address is used
in a comparison, sometimes the program will run but clobber data, give
wrong answers, or loop forever.  In <font size="-1">ANSI</font> C, a pointer into an
array of objects may legally point to the first element after the end
of the array; this is usually safe in older implementations.  This
``outside'' pointer may not be dereferenced.
<!--  -->
<!--  K&R1 does not guarantee this behavior.  See K&R1, pg 188-9. -->
<!--  Most implementations allow it, and it was standardized as a -->
<!--  result.  On some machines, however, it fails.  For example, -->
<!--  on an i80x86, no memory segments are 64k.  Addresses look like -->
<!--  <segment,base>.  If N bytes are allocated and byte N+1 falls off -->
<!--  the end of the segment, the base will wrap around to zero but stay -->
<!--  in the same segment.  For example, adding 1 to <4,65535> gives -->
<!--  <4,0>, so if &s[N-1] == <4,65535>, then &s[N] == <4,0>, which -->
<!--  compares as LESS than the address of the N-1'th element. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Only the <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> comparisons are defined for all
pointers of a given type. It is only portable to use
<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, or <tt>&gt;=</tt>  
to compare pointers when they both point in to (or to the first
element after) the same array.  It is likewise only portable to use
arithmetic operators on pointers that both point into the same array
or the first element afterwards. 
</li><li>
Word size also affects shifts and masks. The following code will clear
only the three rightmost bits of an <tt>int</tt> on <i>some</i>
68000s. On other machines it will also clear the upper two bytes.
<tt>x &amp;= 0177770</tt>. Use instead <tt>x &amp;= ~07</tt>
which works properly on all machines.
<!--  -->
<!--  Originally, I'd said something like ``the or operator (\ |\ ) does -->
<!--  not have these problems'', but that's not true. -->
<!--  Consider -->
<!--  .Ep "foo |= 0177770" -->
<!--  vs. -->
<!--  .Ep "foo |= ~07"  -->
<!-- . -->
Bitfields do not have these problems.
</li><li>
Side effects within expressions can result in code
whose semantics are compiler-dependent, since C's order of evaluation
is explicitly undefined in most places.
Notorious examples include the following.
<pre>a[i] = b[i++];
</pre>
In the above example, we know only that the subscript into <tt>b</tt>
has not been incremented. The index into <tt>a</tt> could be the value
of <tt>i</tt> either before or after the increment. 
<pre>struct bar_t { struct bar_t *next; } bar;
bar-&gt;next = bar = tmp;
</pre>
In the second example, the address of <tt>bar-&gt;next</tt>
may be computed before the value is assigned to <tt>bar</tt>.
<pre>bar = bar-&gt;next = tmp;
</pre>
In the third example, <tt>bar</tt> can be assigned before
<tt>bar-&gt;next</tt>.  Although this <i>appears</i> to violate the rule
that ``assignment proceeds right-to-left'', it is a legal
interpretation. Consider the following example:
<pre>long i;
short a[N];
i = old
i = a[i] = new;
</pre>
The value that <tt>i</tt> is assigned must be a value that is typed as
if assignment proceeded right-to-left. However, <tt>i</tt> may be
assigned the value ``<tt>(long)(short)new</tt>'' before <tt>a[i]</tt>
is assigned to. Compilers do differ. 
<!--  -->
<!--  More: if you write -->
<!--   -->
<!--  		short b; -->
<!--  		long a,c; -->
<!--  		 ... -->
<!--  		a = b = c; -->
<!--   -->
<!--  assignment ``proceeds AS IF right-to-left''.  The following is a -->
<!--  legal implementation: -->
<!--   -->
<!--  		b = (short) c; -->
<!--  		a = (long) b; -->
<!--   -->
<!--  A compiler is also allowed to implement it as: -->
<!--   -->
<!--  		a = (long) (short) c; -->
<!--  		b = (short) c; -->
<!--   -->
<!--  since the same values are being assigned in each case.  But the -->
<!--  assignment is not "proceeding right to left" in the second -->
<!--  example, because a is assigned before b is.  This matters if b is -->
<!--  replaced with an expression. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Be suspicious of numeric values appearing in the code (``magic
numbers'').
</li><li>
Avoid preprocessor tricks.  Tricks such as using <tt>/**/</tt>
for token pasting and macros that rely on argument string expansion
will break reliably. 
<pre>#define FOO(string)	(printf("string = %s",(string)))
 ...
FOO(filename);
</pre>
Will only sometimes be expanded to
<pre>(printf("filename = %s",(filename)))
</pre>
Be aware, however, that tricky preprocessors may cause macros to break
<i>accidentally</i> on some machines.  Consider the following two
versions of a macro. 
<pre>#define LOOKUP(chr)	(a['c'+(chr)])	/* Works as intended. */
#define LOOKUP(c)	(a['c'+(c)])		/* Sometimes breaks. */
</pre>
The second version of <tt>LOOKUP</tt> can be expanded in two different
ways and will cause code to break mysteriously.
</li><li>
Become familiar with existing library functions and defines.  (But not
<i>too</i> familiar.  The internal details of library facilities, as
opposed to their external interfaces, are subject to change without
warning.  They are also often quite unportable.)  You should not be
writing your own string compare routine, terminal control routines, or
making your own defines for system structures.  ``Rolling your own''
wastes your time and makes your code less readable, because another
reader has to figure out whether you're doing something special in
that reimplemented stuff to justify its existence.  It also prevents
your program from taking advantage of any microcode assists or other
means of improving performance of system routines.  Furthermore, it's
a fruitful source of bugs.  If possible, be aware of the
<i>differences</i> between the common libraries (such as 
<font size="-1">ANSI</font>, <font size="-1">POSIX</font>, and so on).
</li><li>
Use <i>lint</i> when it is available.
It is a valuable tool for finding machine-dependent constructs as well
as other inconsistencies or program bugs that pass the compiler.
If your compiler has switches to turn on warnings, use them.
</li><li>
Suspect labels inside blocks with the associated <tt>switch</tt>
or <tt>goto</tt> outside the block.
</li><li>
Wherever the type is in doubt, parameters should be cast to the
appropriate type. Always cast NULL when it appears in non-prototyped
function calls. Do not use function calls as a place to do type
cheating. C has confusing promotion rules, so be careful.
For example, if a function expects a 32-bit <tt>long</tt>
and it is passed a 16-bit <tt>int</tt> the stack can get misaligned,
the value can get promoted wrong, etc. 
</li><li>
Use explicit casts when doing arithmetic that mixes signed and
unsigned values. 
</li><li>
The inter-procedural goto, <tt>longjmp</tt>, should be used with
caution.  Many implementations ``forget'' to restore values in
registers. Declare critical values as <tt>volatile</tt> if you can or
comment them as <tt>VOLATILE</tt>.
</li><li>
Some linkers convert names to lower-case and some only recognize the
first six letters as unique. Programs may break quietly on these
systems. 
</li><li>
Beware of compiler extensions. If used, document and consider them as
machine dependencies.
</li><li>

<h2>
ANSI C
</h2>
<p>
Modern C compilers support some or all of the 
<font size="-1">ANSI</font> proposed standard C.  Whenever possible,
write code to run under standard C, and use features such as function
prototypes, constant storage, and volatile storage.  Standard C
improves program performance by giving better information to
optimizers.  Standard C improves portability by insuring that all
compilers accept the same input language and by providing mechanisms
that try to hide machine dependencies or emit warnings about code that
may be machine-dependent.
</p><p>
</p><h3>
17.1 Compatibility
</h3>
<p>
Write code that is easy to port to older compilers. For instance,
conditionally #define new (standard) keywords such as <tt>const</tt>
and <tt>volatile</tt> in a global <i>.h</i> file. Standard compilers
pre-define the preprocessor symbol <tt>__STDC__</tt> (see footnote 8).
The <tt>void*</tt> type is hard to get right simply, since some older
compilers understand <tt>void</tt> but not <tt>void*</tt>. It is
easiest to create a new (machine- and compiler-dependent) <tt>VOIDP</tt>
type, usually <tt>char*</tt> on older compilers.
</p><pre>#if __STDC__
	typedef void *voidp;
#	define COMPILER_SELECTED
#endif
#ifdef A_TARGET
#	define const
#	define volatile
#	define void int
	typedef char *voidp;
#	define COMPILER_SELECTED
#endif
#ifdef ...
	...
#endif
#ifdef COMPILER_SELECTED
#	undef COMPILER_SELECTED
#else
	{ NO TARGET SELECTED! }
#endif
<!--  -->
<!--  Alternatively, we could do -->
<!--  -->
<!--  #ifdef __STDC__ -->
<!-- 	.. -->
<!--  #	define CONST const -->
<!--  #	define VOLATILE volatile -->
<!--  #else -->
<!-- 	.. -->
<!--  #endif -->
<!--  -->
<!--  Is one of these better?  Probably not, it will be a strange -->
<!--  anachronism when everybody has forgotten that const once didn't -->
<!--  exist. -->
<!--  -->
</pre>
<p>
Note that under <font size="-1">ANSI</font> C, the `#' for a
preprocessor directive must be the first non-whitespace character on a
line. Under older compilers it must be the first character on the line.
</p><p>
When a static function has a forward declaration, the forward
declaration must include the storage class.
For older compilers, the class must be ``<tt>extern</tt>''.
For <font size="-1">ANSI</font> compilers, the class must be
``<tt>static</tt>'' but global functions must still be declared as 
``<tt>extern</tt>''.
Thus, forward declarations of static functions should use a 
<tt>#define</tt> such as <tt>FWD_STATIC</tt> that is 
<tt>#ifdef</tt>fed as appropriate. 
</p><p>
An ``<tt>#ifdef NAME</tt>'' should end with either
``<tt>#endif</tt>'' or ``<tt>#endif /* NAME */</tt>'',
<i>not</i> with ``<tt>#endif NAME</tt>''.
The comment should not be used on short #ifdefs,
as it is clear from the code.
</p><p>
<font size="-1">ANSI</font> <i>trigraphs</i>
may cause programs with strings containing <tt>??</tt>
to break mysteriously.
<!--  -->
<!--  ``sed -e "s;??\\([-=(/)'<!>]\\);?\\\\?\\1;g" -->
<!--  will fix them...	-- Karl Heuer -->
<!--  -->
</p><p>
</p><h3>
17.2 Formatting
</h3>
<p>
The style for <font size="-1">ANSI</font> C is the same as for regular
C, with two notable exceptions: storage qualifiers and parameter lists.
</p><p>
Because <tt>const</tt> and <tt>volatile</tt> have strange binding
rules, 
<!--  -->
<!--  In particular, "char const *s, *t" means both `t' and `s' point -->
<!--  to constant storage, while "char * const s, *t" means that s is -->
<!--  a constant, but `t' isn't. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  I think. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  `*' binds differently than `const'. -->
<!--  -->
each <tt>const</tt> or <tt>volatile</tt> object should have a separate
declaration. 
</p><pre>int const *s;		/* YES */
int const *s, *t;	/* NO */
</pre>
<p>
Prototyped functions merge parameter declaration and definition in to
one list. Parameters should be commented in the function comment.
</p><pre>/*
 * `bp': boat trying to get in.
 * `stall': a list of stalls, never NULL.
 * returns stall number, 0 =&gt; no room.
 */
	int
enter_pier (boat_t const *bp, stall_t *stall)
{
	...
</pre>
<p>
</p><h3>
17.3 Prototypes
</h3>
<p>
Function prototypes should be used to make code more robust and to
make it run faster. Unfortunately, the prototyped <i>declaration</i>
</p><pre>extern void bork (char c);
</pre>
is incompatible with the <i>definition</i>
<pre>	void
bork (c)
	char c;
{
	...
</pre>
The prototype says that <tt>c</tt> is to be passed as the most natural
type for the machine, possibly a byte. The non-prototyped
(backwards-compatible) definition implies that <tt>c</tt> is always
passed as an <tt>int </tt> (see footnote 9). If a function has
promotable parameters then the caller and callee must be compiled
identically.  Either both must use function prototypes or neither can
use prototypes.  The problem can be avoided if parameters are promoted
when the program is designed.  For example, <tt>bork</tt> can be
defined to take an <tt>int</tt> parameter.
<p>
The above declaration works if the definition is prototyped.
</p><pre>	void
bork (char c)
{
	...
</pre>
Unfortunately, the prototyped syntax will cause non-<font size="-1">ANSI</font> compilers to reject the program.
<!--  -->
<!--  There is no obvious way to define the function so that -->
<!--  prototypes are used only when an \s-1ANSI\s+1 compiler is used. -->
<!--  Prototyped and nonprototyped declarations can be #ifdeffed on -->
<!--  .Ep __STDC__ , -->
<!--  but the extra #ifdeffing causes maintainance problems -->
<!--  and makes the code hard to read. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  Oh yeah, try -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 	int DEFUN (foo, (a, p), int a AND char *p) -->
<!-- 	int foo FUN2(int, a, char *, p) -->
<!--  -->
<!--  But beware: ``Don't change the syntax via macro substitution.'' -->
<!--  -->
<p>
It <i>is</i> easy to write external declarations that work with both
prototyping and with older compilers (see footnote 10).
</p><pre>#if __STDC__
#	define PROTO(x) x
#else
#	define PROTO(x) ()
#endif

extern char **ncopies PROTO((char *s, short times));
</pre>
Note that <tt>PROTO</tt> must be used with <i>double</i> parentheses.
<p>
In the end, it may be best to write in only one style (e.g., with
prototypes). When a non-prototyped version is needed, it is generated
using an automatic conversion tool.
</p><p>
</p><h3>
17.4 Pragmas
</h3>
<p>
Pragmas are used to introduce machine-dependent code in a controlled
way.  Obviously, pragmas should be treated as machine dependencies.
Unfortunately, the syntax of <font size="-1">ANSI</font> pragmas
makes it impossible to isolate them in machine-dependent headers.
</p><p>
Pragmas are of two classes. <i>Optimizations</i> may safely be
ignored. Pragmas that change the system behavior (``required
pragmas'')  may not. Required pragmas should be  <tt>#ifdef</tt>fed so
that compilation will abort if no pragma is selected.
</p><p>
Two compilers may use a given pragma in two very different ways.
For instance, one compiler may use <tt>haggis</tt> to signal an
optimization. Another might use it to indicate that a given statement,
if reached, should terminate the program. Thus, when pragmas are used,
they must always be enclosed in machine-dependent #ifdefs.  Pragmas
must always be #ifdefed out for non-<font size="-1">ANSI</font>
compilers. Be sure to indent the `#' character on the
<tt>#pragma</tt>, as older preprocessors will halt on it otherwise.
</p><pre>#if defined(__STDC__) &amp;&amp; defined(USE_HAGGIS_PRAGMA)
	#pragma (HAGGIS)
#endif
</pre>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
``<i>The `#pragma' command is specified in the
<font size="-1">ANSI</font> standard to have an 
arbitrary implementation-defined effect.
In the GNU C preprocessor, `#pragma' first attempts to run the game
`rogue'; if that fails, it tries to run the game `hack'; if that
fails, it tries to run GNU Emacs displaying the Tower of Hanoi; if
that fails, it reports a fatal error.
In any case, preprocessing does not continue.</i>''

<h2>
Special Considerations
</h2>
<p>
This section contains some miscellaneous do's and don'ts.
<!--  -->
<!--  This should probably be either "dos and don'ts" or -->
<!--  "do's and don't's", but neither looks quite right. -->
<!--  -->
</p><ul>
<li>
Don't change syntax via macro substitution.
It makes the program unintelligible to all but the perpetrator.
</li><li>
Don't use floating-point variables where discrete values are needed.
Using a <tt>float</tt> for a loop counter is a great way to shoot
yourself in the foot. Always test floating-point numbers as
<i>&lt;=</i> or <i>&gt;=</i>, never use an exact comparison (<i>==</i>
or <i>!=</i>). 
</li><li>
Compilers have bugs.  Common trouble spots include structure
assignment and bitfields.  You cannot generally predict which bugs a
compiler has.  You <i>could</i> write a program that avoids all
constructs that are known broken on all compilers.  You won't be able
to write anything useful, you might still encounter bugs, and the
compiler might get fixed in the meanwhile.  Thus, you should write
``around'' compiler bugs only when you are <i>forced</i> to use a
particular buggy compiler.
</li><li>
Do not rely on automatic beautifiers.  The main person who benefits
from good program style is the programmer him/herself, and especially
in the early design of handwritten algorithms or pseudo-code.
Automatic beautifiers can only be applied to complete, syntactically
correct programs and hence are not available when the need for
attention to white space and indentation is greatest.  Programmers can
do a better job of making clear the complete visual layout of a
function or file, with the normal attention to detail of a careful
programmer.  (In other words, some of the visual layout is dictated by
intent rather than syntax and beautifiers cannot read minds.)  Sloppy
programmers should learn to be careful programmers instead of relying
on a beautifier to make their code readable.
<!--  -->
<!--  Finally, beautifiers are nontrivial, can have bugs, and never do a -->
<!--  perfect job. -->
<!--  Also, beautifiers do things such as silently taking -->
<!--  .Ep x=-1; -->
<!--  to be old-style syntax for -->
<!--  .Ep x -= 1; -->
<!--  even though that might not be what is wanted, and -->
<!--  such a conversion is <I>wrong</I> for ANSI-C input. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>
Accidental omission of the second <tt>=</tt> of the logical compare is
a problem.  Use explicit tests. Avoid assignment with implicit test.
<pre>abool = bbool;
if (abool) { ...
</pre>
When embedded assignment <i>is</i> used, make the test explicit
so that it doesn't get ``fixed'' later.
<pre>while ((abool = bbool) != FALSE) { ...
</pre>
<pre>while (abool = bbool) { ...	/* VALUSED */
</pre>
<pre>while (abool = bbool, abool) { ...
</pre>
<!--  -->
<!--  I happen to think the following is ugly, but it works if one of -->
<!--  the values is a constant. -->
<!--  The ``trick'' is to put a non-lvalue on the lhs. -->
<!--  The compiler then barfs if an -->
<!--  .Ep = '' `` -->
<!--  is typed instead of the intended -->
<!--  .Ep == ''. `` -->
<!--  -->
<!--  <PRE> -->
<!--  if (2 == i) {...} -->
<!--  </PRE> -->
</li><li>
Explicitly comment variables that are changed out of the normal
control flow, or other code that is likely to break during
maintenance.
</li><li>
Modern compilers will put variables in registers automatically.
Use the <tt>register</tt> sparingly to indicate the variables that you
think are most critical.  In extreme cases, mark the 2-4 most critical
values as <tt>register</tt> and mark the rest as <tt>REGISTER.</tt>
The latter can be #defined to <tt>register</tt> on those machines with
many registers.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Lint
</h2>
<p>
<i>Lint</i> is a C program checker [2][11] that examines C source files
to detect and report type incompatibilities, inconsistencies between
function definitions and calls, potential program bugs, etc.
The use of <i>lint</i> on all programs is strongly recommended,
and it is expected that most projects will require programs to use
<i>lint</i> as part of the official acceptance procedure.
</p><p>
It should be noted that the best way to use <i>lint</i> is not as a
barrier that must be overcome before official acceptance of a program,
but rather as a tool to use during and after changes or additions to
the code.
<i>Lint</i>
can find obscure bugs and insure portability before problems occur.
Many messages from <i>lint</i> really do indicate something wrong.
One fun story is about is about a program that was missing
an argument to <tt>fprintf</tt>.
</p><pre>fprintf ("Usage: foo -bar &lt;file&gt;\n");
</pre>
The <i>author</i> never had a problem. But the program dumped core
every time an ordinary user made a mistake on the command line.
Many versions of <i>lint</i> will catch this.
<p>
Most options are worth learning. Some options may complain about
legitimate things, but they will also pick up many botches.  Note that
`--p' (see footnote 11) checks function-call type-consistency for only a
subset of library routines, so programs should be linted both with and
without --p for the best ``coverage''.
</p><p>
<i>Lint</i> also recognizes several special comments in the code.
These comments both shut up <i>lint</i> when the code otherwise makes
it complain, and also document special code.
</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Make
</h2>
<p>
One other very useful tool is <i>make</i> [7]. During development,
<i>make</i> recompiles only those modules that have been changed
since the last time <i>make</i> was used. It can be used to automate
other tasks, as well. Some common conventions include:
</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td align="RIGHT">all		</td><td><i>always</i> makes all binaries</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">clean	</td><td>	remove all intermediate files</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">debug	</td><td>	make a test binary 'a.out' or 'debug'</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">depend	</td><td>	make transitive dependencies</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">install	</td><td>	install binaries, libraries, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">deinstall	</td><td>	back out of ``install''</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">mkcat	</td><td>	install the manual page(s)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">lint	</td><td>	run lint</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">print/list	</td><td>	make a hard copy of all source files</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">shar	</td><td>	make a shar of all source files</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">spotless	</td><td>	make clean, use revision control to put away sources.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">&nbsp;	</td><td>	Note: doesn't remove Makefile, although it is a source file</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">source	</td><td>	undo what spotless did</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">tags	</td><td>	run ctags, (using the -t flag is suggested)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT">rdist	</td><td>	distribute sources to other hosts</td></tr>
<tr><td align="RIGHT"><i>file.c</i></td><td>	check out the named file from revision control</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
In addition, command-line defines can be given to define either
Makefile values (such as ``CFLAGS'') or values in the program
(such as ``DEBUG'').
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Project-Dependent Standards
</h2>
<p>
Individual projects may wish to establish additional standards beyond
those given here.
The following issues are some of those that should be addressed by
each project program administration group.
</p><ul>
<li>
What additional naming conventions should be followed?
In particular, systematic prefix conventions for functional grouping
of global data and also for structure or union member names can be
useful.
</li><li>
What kind of include file organization is appropriate for the
project's particular data hierarchy?
</li><li>
What procedures should be established for reviewing <i>lint</i>
complaints?
A tolerance level needs to be established in concert with the <i>lint</i>
options to prevent unimportant complaints from hiding complaints about
real bugs or inconsistencies.
</li><li>
If a project establishes its own archive libraries, it should plan on
supplying a lint library file [2] to the system administrators.
The lint library file allows <i>lint</i> to check for compatible use of
library functions.
</li><li>
What kind of revision control needs to be used?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><hr>
<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
A set of standards has been presented for C programming style.
Among the most important points are:
</p><ul>
<li>
The proper use of white space and comments so that the structure of
the program is evident from the layout of the code.  The use of simple
expressions, statements, and functions so that they may be understood
easily.
</li><li>
To keep in mind that you or someone else will likely be asked to
modify code or make it run on a different machine sometime in the
future.  Craft code so that it is portable to obscure machines.
Localize optimizations since they are often confusing and may be
``pessimizations'' on other machines.
</li><li>
Many style choices are arbitrary.  Having a style that is consistent
(particularly with group standards) is more important than following
absolute style rules.  Mixing styles is worse than using any single
bad style.
</li></ul>
<p>
As with any standard, it must be followed if it is to be useful.  If
you have trouble following any of these standards don't just ignore
them.  Talk with your local guru, or an experienced programmer at your
institution.

Some automated program-analysis
packages use different characters before comment lines as
a marker for lines with specific items of information.

``Tabstops'' can be blanks (spaces) inserted by your editor in clumps

</li><li>  <!-- 5 -->
Use <tt>#define void</tt> or <tt>#define void int</tt> for compilers
without the <tt>void</tt> keyword.
</li><li>  <!-- 6 -->
The code may also fail to compile, fault on pointer creation,
fault on pointer comparison, or fault on pointer dereferences.
</li><li>  <!-- 7 -->
Some libraries attempt to modify and then restore read-only
string variables.  Programs sometimes won't port because of these
broken libraries.  The libraries are getting better.
</li><li>  <!-- 8 -->
Some compilers predefine <tt>__STDC__</tt> to be 0, in an attempt to
indicate partial compliance with the <font size="-1">ANSI</font> C 
standard. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine <i>which</i>
<font size="-1">ANSI</font> facilities are provided. Thus, such
compilers are broken. See the rule about ``don't write around a broken
compiler unless you are forced to.'' 
<!--  -->
<!--  Although the 1989 \s-1ANSI\s+1 standard (X3.159-1989) -->
<!--  defines __STDC__ as 1, later -->
<!--  versions may define it to be another number. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  There's nothing keeping a vendor from defining __STDC__ to 0, or 1, or -->
<!--  "hi" or anything else.  It is guaranteed that a conforming -->
<!--  compiler will have __STDC__ set, and in particular that an -->
<!--  \s-1ANSI\s+1-89-compliant compiler will set it to 1.  However, ``A implies -->
<!--  B'' does not mean ``B implies A''.  That is, a nonconformant -->
<!--  compiler can do anything it damn well pleases: interpret `while' -->
<!--  to mean `abort compilation', rearrange expressions arbitrarily, or -->
<!--  even set __STDC__ to zero.  Such usage is  broken because the -->
<!--  vendor KNOWS that users are expecting __STDC__ to mean \s-1ANSI\s+1 -->
<!--  compliant and the vendor also KNOWS that the compiler isn't -->
<!--  \s-1ANSI\s+1-compliant. -->
<!--  -->
</li><li>  <!-- 9 -->
Such automatic type promotion is called <i>widening</i>. For older
compilers, the widening rules require that all <tt>char</tt> and
<tt>short</tt> parameters are passed as <tt>int</tt>s and that
<tt>float</tt> parameters are passed as <tt>double</tt>s.
</li><li> <!-- 10 -->
Note that using <tt>PROTO</tt> violates the rule ``don't change the
syntax via macro substitution.''  It is regrettable that there isn't a
better solution.

<h2>
The Ten Commandments for C Programmers
</h2>
<i>Henry Spencer</i>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Thou shalt run <i>lint</i> frequently and study its pronouncements with
care, for verily its perception and judgement oft exceed thine.
</li><li>
Thou shalt not follow the NULL pointer, for chaos and madness await
thee at its end. 
</li><li>
Thou shalt cast all function arguments to the expected type if they
are not of that type already, even when thou art convinced that this
is unnecessary, lest they take cruel vengeance upon thee when thou
least expect it. 
</li><li>
If thy header files fail to declare the return types of thy library
functions, thou shalt declare them thyself with the most meticulous
care, lest grievous harm befall thy program.
</li><li>
Thou shalt check the array bounds of all strings (indeed, all arrays),
for surely where thou typest ``foo'' someone someday shall type
``supercalifragilisticexpialidocious''.
</li><li>
If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of
difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the
checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing
fingers, for if thou thinkest ``it cannot happen to me'', the gods
shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance. 
</li><li>
Thou shalt study thy libraries and strive not to re-invent them
without cause, that thy code may be short and readable and thy days
pleasant and productive.
</li><li>
Thou shalt make thy program's purpose and structure clear to thy
fellow man by using the One True Brace Style, even if thou likest it
not, for thy creativity is better used in solving problems than in
creating beautiful new impediments to understanding.
</li><li>
Thy external identifiers shall be unique in the first six characters,
though this harsh discipline be irksome and the years of its necessity
stretch before thee seemingly without end, lest thou tear thy hair out
and go mad on that fateful day when thou desirest to make thy program
run on an old system. 
</li><li>
Thou shalt foreswear, renounce, and abjure the vile heresy which
claimeth that ``All the world's a VAX'', and have no commerce with the
benighted heathens who cling to this barbarous belief, that the days
of thy program may be long even though the days of thy current machine
be short. 
</li></ol>
